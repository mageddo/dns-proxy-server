## Summary & Motivation

> A short description of what is it and why it's important to be considered. (Required)

Example:

> Provide a solver which can solve from previously configured DNS records.
> It's will be useful because people can use DPS for static DNS entries instead of use /etc/hosts or something like.

## Goals

> What is supposed to do in short. (Optional)

Example

> A simple, static DNS server

## Non-Goals

> What people would think it is supposed to do, but it is not? (Optional)

Example
> * Not to implement a full and complex DNS server

## Description

> Explain the feature details and how it would work, usecases, examples, snippets of code,
> inputs and outputs, etc. (Required)

Example
