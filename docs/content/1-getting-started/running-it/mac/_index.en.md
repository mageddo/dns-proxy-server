## Running on MAC

DPS actually is fully supported on MAC knowing [docker limitation features][5]. Despite on this,
there is **no** additional configuration to run DPS on Mac, you can do just like [on Linux](#running-on-linux).

Download the [latest release][3], extract and run:
```bash
$ sudo ./dns-proxy-server
```

(todo: Add usages examples here)

When running on standalone mode (not on docker container) DPS will be able to auto configure itself as OSX default DNS,
after 5 seconds you see something like `usingDnsConfigurator=DnsConfiguratorOSx` at the logs.

## Running on Docker
It's also possible to run DPS on docker you can do it in different ways, bellow the most recommended.

(todo: Explain)

## Configuring DPS as default DNS manually

When not running in standalone mode you will need to configure DPS as default DPS manually,
check the instructions bellow:

To list available networks:
```bash
$ networksetup -listallnetworkservices
An asterisk (*) denotes that a network service is disabled.
USB 10/100/1000 LAN
Wi-Fi
Thunderbolt Bridge
```
In my case the right Network is `Wi-Fi`, before change anything let's check if it has some manual
configured DNS server:
```bash
$ networksetup -getdnsservers Wi-Fi
There aren't any DNS Servers set on Wi-Fi. 
```
If it returns some server IP then is a good idea to backup it then you can restore the configurations later.

Let's set DPS as the default DNS Server, best option here is to get your network IP address, `Wi-Fi` in my case which
has `192.168.0.14` set, `127.0.0.1` will partially works because this way containers won't be able 
to solve each other in my tests. 

**Obs**: Be aware you need to run DPS in port **53** as MAC doesn't accept custom port especification.

```bash
$ networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 192.168.0.14
```

If you need to remove the configured DNS server then it will use your network provider DNS
```bash
$ networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi Empty
```

See [this thread][6] with more use cases.
